# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! Please follow these rules:

- Keep raw CSVs out of the repo (they belong in `C:\data\` locally). Add only small sample CSVs (<1MB) if needed.
- Use the lesson template in `notebooks/` and `sql/projects/` when adding new materials.
- Run SQL style checks with SQLFluff before opening a PR.
- Use clear commit messages and reference the syllabus module number.

See `tools/README.md` for recommended dev environment (Python, `psycopg2`, `psql`).
